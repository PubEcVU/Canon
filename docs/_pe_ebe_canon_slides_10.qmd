### Inequality of Income, Consumption or Wealth

* to quantify inequality, often one uses microdata on (household) income
* this could be survey or administrative data
     + since the introduction of the income tax, about 100 years ago, governments know who reports how much income, and they keep administrative registers
* consumption is only available from survey data, and often preferred in the context of developing countries
     + smallholder farmers (consumer-producers) may consume what they produce, their market income may underestimate their welfare levels
     + self-employment is partly associated with income tax evasion
     + consumption tends to fluctuate less as households engage in consumption smoothing over time, and across members of the family or household
* recent attention to wealth inequality, as microeconomic survey data became available, but since many countries do not have a comprehensive wealth tax, reliable measures of wealth at the micro level are scarce

<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Statistical Distributions

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### PDF, CDF

* measuring inequality is about describing and quantifying inequality of some distribution of a variable of interest (income, wealth, consumption) in statistical terms
* let $Y$ denote the variable of interest
* main idea: take the values $Y$ (or a random sample) as given and study the aspects of its distribution that tell how 'different' people are from one another
* if $Y$ is continuously distributed, then its distribution can be represented by 
     + a probability density function (pdf) $f_Y(y)$, or 
     + a cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F_Y(y)=\int_{\min\{y\}}^y f(z) \text{d}z$
* statistical distributions are often characterized by their *moments* (such as mean, $\mu$, standard deviation, $\sigma$, and many others)

### [Lorenz]{.smallcaps} Curve and [Gini]{.smallcaps} Coefficient

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Description

* most popular measure for inequality are [Gini]{.smallcaps} coefficient and [Lorenz]{.smallcaps} curve $\Lambda$
* $\Lambda$ encompasses all values of the distribution and can be derived from the pdf or cdf $F$:


<!-- multicolumn setup .................................................... -->
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
$${\Lambda(F)={\frac {\int _{0}^{F}F^{-1}(z)\,dz}{\int _{0}^{1}F^{-1}(z)\,dz}}}$$

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-important icon="false" title="We shall derive $\Lambda$ graphically in class."}

<!-- end multicolumn setup ................................................ -->

* starting point are the values of $Y$ in *ascending* order
* determine $p$, the cumulative percentile of individuals considered (runs from 0 to 100\%)
* $\Lambda$ measures for each $p$ the cumulative share of income in total income  (runs from 0 to 100\%)
* $\Lambda$ is typically below the 45$^\circ$line, monotonically increasing and convex 
* [Gini]{.smallcaps} coefficient of inequality is based on the cumulative difference between the line of equality and the [Lorenz]{.smallcaps} curve

### Inequality and Policy

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Redistribution
* If SWF suggests that inequality is of policy concern, then redistribution, typically from the rich to the poor, is a possible choice
* note: such redistribution does not tackle the causes of inequality, rather its symptoms
* distribution of incomes $\{y_1,\ldots,y_N\}$
* Budget-neutral redistribution: tax everyone using proportional income tax $\tau$, redistribute total tax revenue $\sum_i \tau y_i$ as a lump sum to everyone:
$$
\mbox{after-tax income } \tilde{y}_i = y_i(1-\tau)+\frac{\tau \sum_i  y_i}{N}
$$
* assume mean income does not change with redistribution (see notes)$^\dagger$

::: {.callout-important icon="false" title="We shall show the effect of redistribution on $\Lambda$ graphically in class."}
:::

#### Illustration

<!-- multicolumn setup .................................................... -->
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/lorenz3.png)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

* redistribution shifts the $\Lambda$ curve towards the line of equality and reduces the [Gini]{.smallcaps}
* [Atkinson]{.smallcaps} has shown that social welfare, as measured through any concave SWF, increases with such redistribution (see notes)$^\ddagger$

:::


::::
<!-- END multicolumn setup ................................................ -->


#### Notes

* $^\dagger$ ideally, one should take into account behavioral effects of redistributional taxation, that is, redistribution may be associated with (possibly large) negative effects on labor supply and earnings; in that case, society "buys" more equality with "less efficiency" and lower mean income (see the equity/efficiency trade-off, and the Second Best)
* $^\ddagger$ [Lorenz]{.smallcaps} curves such as $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda'$ curves might cross one another; in that case, it is unclear from those curves alone which distribution has more inequality

### SWF and Incomes

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### SWF


```{=latex}
\begin{itemize}
\item
        SWF typically written as 
        $$W=W(\color{blue}{u^1},\color{red}{u^2}),$$
        and $u^1(),u^2()$ are functions of consumptions, e.g.,
        $\color{blue}{u^1}(x_1,x_2)$
\item
        however, at given income $y_1$ of individual 1,
        consumption demands of that person for goods 1 and 2 are
        $$x^1_1=x^1_1(p_1,p_2,y_1) \qquad \text{and} \qquad x^1_2=x^1_2(p_1,p_2,y_1)$$
\item
        then, at the optimal demands, \alert{indirect utility} is defined as
        $$v^1(x^1_1(p_1,p_2,\color{blue}{y_1}),x^1_2(p_1,p_2,\color{blue}{y_1}))\equiv v^1(p_1,p_2,\color{blue}{y_1})$$
\item
        and so $W$ is a function of individual incomes
        $$W=W(v^1(p_1,p_2,\color{blue}{y_1}),v^2(p_1,p_2,\color{red}{y_2})) = W(\color{blue}{y_1},\color{red}{y_2})$$
\end{itemize}
```

#### Inequality

```{=latex}
\begin{itemize}
\item
        social welfare may increase with equality of incomes
\item
        consider utilitarian  SWF $W=u^1+u^2+\cdots = \sum_h u^h$ and rewrite as
        \[
        W=\sum v^h(y_h)
        \]
\item
        equally distributed equivalent income $y_{ede}$:
        \[
        \sum_h v^h(y_h)
        =\sum_h v^h(y_{ede})
        \]
\item
        society is willing to give up $\pi = \mu - y_{ede}$ to eliminate inequality ($\pi$ inequality premium {\gray compare: risk premium})
\item
        suppose, all $v^h=v$ (identical): the more curved $v$, the stronger the effect of unequal incomes on welfare: \alert{inequality aversion} $\uparrow$
\end{itemize}
```

### Link SWF and Welfare Indices

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Marginal SW Weight

```{=latex}
\begin{itemize}
\item
        compare two income distributions ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$ with $\mu_{\cal A}=\mu_{\cal B}$, for which {$\Lambda({\cal A}) > \Lambda({\cal B})$} 
\item
        then, if \textsc{Lorenz} curves do not cross, ${\cal A}$ has higher welfare than ${\cal B}$ under every \alert{symmetric and concave} SWF
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
                need not know SWF to say that social welfare is higher under ${\cal A}$
        \end{itemize}
\item
        conversely, if \textsc{Lorenz} curves do cross, different rankings can be obtained
        \begin{itemize}
        \item
                need to know SWF to say whether social welfare is higher under ${\cal A}$ or  under ${\cal B}$
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
```
#### Intuition

```{=latex}
\begin{itemize}
\item
        income-based SWF: marginal social welfare weight $\omega_i = \partial W/\partial v^i\cdot\partial v^i/\partial y_i$ will be rewritten
        $$\frac{\partial W}{\partial y_i}$$
\item
        for $y_1<y_2$, have 
        $$\frac{\partial W}{\partial y_1}\ge \frac{\partial W}{\partial y_2}$$
        i.e., a dollar extra for the poor counts more, because $W$ is assumed concave in incomes
\item
        transfer of 1\$ from rich to poor, makes society better off, $W\uparrow$        
\end{itemize}

## Poverty {background-color="#acfaf7"}

<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Poverty

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Definition

Poverty, specifically

* lack of command over commodities
     + "&hellip; a severe constriction of the choice set [over commodities]" ([Harold Watts]{.smallcaps})

* Lack of specific consumptions in terms of quantity or quality 
     + e.g. too little food energy intake, too little of specific nutrients, leaking roof, &hellip;

Poverty, more generally

* lack of "welfare" in wider sense
     + e.g. lack of "capability": inability to achieve certain "functionings"
     + "beings and doings" (Amartya [Sen]{.smallcaps})

#### Aim of Measurement

* supply evidence / quantitative data to inform policy on the extent, developments/trends, and severity of poverty
* keep poor people on the political agenda

####  Policies

* Growth strategy
     + Has poverty increased? Did growth help the poor? How did relative price changesaffect the poor? What is the impact of food price fluctuations? Who were the losers and who were the gainersfrom economy-wide policy reforms?
* Social Spending
     + Who uses public services? At what cost? Who benefits from government subsidies? On average, versus at the margin? Who will be hurt by retrenchment?
* Targeted Interventions
     + Who are the target groups? How should transfers be allocated? How much impact will they have on poverty?

<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Canonical Poverty Measures

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Measures

Canonical statistical measures of poverty (Poverty Indices, PI)

* **headcount ratio** (HC): what percentage of population has income below poverty line?
     + easy to measure and understand
* **poverty gap** (PG): what is the average relative distance of the poor from the poverty line?
     + reflects (average) depth of poverty
* **squared PG** (SPG): what is the average relative squared distance of the poor from the poverty line?
     + reflects severity of poverty, as it gives the highest weight to the poorest

### Axiomatic Poverty Indices

* problem: ad-hoc measures may fail to detect poverty or overemphasize it
* [Sen]{.smallcaps}'s concept: starts from desirable properties of poverty measures
    + anonymity: identity of household does not matter
    + weak transfer axiom: poverty decreases with redistribution among the poor
    + monotonicity: poverty declines with rising income of the poor
    + focus axiom: redistribution among the non-poor does not change poverty

* [Sen]{.smallcaps}'s index: combination of measures
$${\cal I}_{Sen} = HC \left[ IGR + (1-IGR) G^P \frac{H}{H+1} \right]$$
    + $IGR$: income gap ratio $\displaystyle IGR = \frac{PG/H}{z}$
    +  $G^P$: [Gini]{.smallcaps} among the poor


### Poverty Relief Measures and Consumer Choice

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Tools {.smaller}

* transfers are used to address poverty to targeted and identified individuals
     + in cash or in kind
* cash transfers can be used to 
     + move individuals back to the poverty line in terms of disposable income

     + counteract a price hike on specific goods
          + e.g., using the idea of **compensating variation**
* in-kind transfers for particular expenditure categories (necessitities)
     + e.g., social/council housing; food stamps/coupons/special debit cards; reduced public transport fares; access to health services
     + in-kind transfers reduce the choice set

## Summary and Conclusions {background-color="#acfaf7" .unnumbered}

<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Summary

* [Lorenz]{.smallcaps} curve and [Gini]{.smallcaps} coefficient as standard statistical measure for inequality assessment
    + there are many others, all with their own properties (e.g. [Theil]{.smallcaps} or [Atkinson]{.smallcaps} indices)
    + in practice, descriptive measures showing inequality through the top-1% share or 90/10 ratio are popular
* redistribution is welfare-enhancing under a convex SWF, and can be achieved using a simple budget-neutral tax-benefit system (assuming no behavioral response)
    + to some degree, there is a link between inequality and SWF
* poverty measurements are often tied to distributional aspects (relative poverty)
* poverty policy aims at providing a consumption floor
* benefit design can dis-/encourage labor supply (participation)
* in-kind provision: targeting and self-selection of the needy
* unintended side effect of means testing: discourage effort taking
