### Recap: Exchange & Consumption Efficiency

* [Edgeworth]{.smallcaps} box: two consumer $(A,B)$/two goods $(x,y)$ exchange model with endowment point $E$
* [Pareto]{.smallcaps} efficiency:  equalization of *marginal rates of substitution* (MRS) between both consumers:
$$
MRS_A(x,y) = MRS_B(x,y)
$${#eq-MRSA_MRSB}

#### Contract Curve

* locus of allocations that fulfills (@eq-MRSA_MRSB)

#### Core

* segment of contract curve reachable from $E$

### Recap: First Theorem of Welfare Economics

<br>

::: {.callout-caution title="First Theorem of Welfare Economics" icon="false"}
Under strict conditions, a competitive market equilibrium is [Pareto]{.smallcaps}  efficient.
::: 

* i.o.w.: market clearing $\implies$ efficiency

* in the [Edgeworth]{.smallcaps} Box, this implies:
    + starting from endowment $E$, market interaction and market clearing lead to equilibrium market prices that make agents pick allocation $M$
    + 1st Theorem implies: $M$ is on the contract curve (in the core) and thus [Pareto]{.smallcaps} efficient 
    + $M$ can always be reached from $E$

### Utility Possibilities Frontier (UPF)

* we now ask: what are the highest *level* of utilities that individuals can achieve in a 2-person economy with *given resources* or endowments?
* i.o.w.: how much utility can we get out of our endowment of consumption goods, at most, if we are willing to redistribute between agents?
     + increasing consumption (and, hence, utility) of $A$, given [Pareto]{.smallcaps} efficiency, is associated with a decrease in consumption  (and, hence, utility) of $B$
* this linkage gives rise to the *utility possibilities frontier* (UPF)
     + UPF shows the maximum attainable level of utility for all members of society
     + analysis is: given $u_A$, what is $\max u_B$? (or converse)
* then, UPF corresponds to [Pareto]{.smallcaps} efficient allocations on contract curve when we consider the levels of utility

### Recap: Social Welfare Function (SWF)

<!-- multicolumn setup .................................................... -->
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* SWF: society's 'utility' function
* [Bergson-Samuelson]{.smallcaps} SWF is purely based on individual utilities
$$ W=W(u_A,u_B)$$
* social decisions involve trade-off across groups or individuals<br>
     + *interpersonal comparability* of utilities necessary when redistributing
     + utility functions are *cardinal* since utility changes will matter
* curvature of SWF reflects *inequality aversion*, $\varepsilon$

#### First Best

* combining SWF and UPF allows determining the *First Best* social choice, $F$
* technically, UPF acts as a constraint on SWF

### Second Theorem of Welfare Economics

* markets in themselves may generate inequality as a side-effect
* 1st Theorem: market equilibrium is [Pareto]{.smallcaps}  efficient; it is silent on equity
     + how about we redistribute when market outcomes not 'fair' or 'too unequal'

::: {.callout-caution title="Second Theorem of Welfare Economics" icon="false"}

*Any* [Pareto]{.smallcaps}  efficient outcome can be *decentralized* as a competitive equilibrium, for some distribution of initial endowments.

::: 

* i.o.w.: market clearing $\impliedby$ efficiency
     + distribution function as additional role of government

::: {.callout-caution title="Separability" icon="false"}

* when first best is achievable, equity and efficiency are, in fact, *separable*
* needs initial, non-distortionary *lump-sum* taxes and transfers before market interaction starts

### Lump Sum Redistribution

:::{.center-h}
![](images/2FTWE_upf.png){width=85%}
:::

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
* lump-sum taxes and transfers are tied to the identity of the tax payer or transfer recipient, but not to individual's choices (e.g.: income,  consumption, wealth) and can therefore not be influenced
:::


<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Second Best: Motivation

Consider a redistribution program that takes from the rich and gives to the poor.

<!-- multicolumn setup .................................................... -->
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

> <q> [&hellip;] the money must be carried from the rich to the poor in a leaky bucket.  Some of it will simply disappear in transit, so the poor will not receive 
all the money that is taken from the rich. [&hellip;]
> I want you to decide how much leakage you would accept and still support [this plan]. Suppose 10 percent leaks out [&hellip;] Should society still make the switch? If 50 percent leaks out? 75 percent? [&hellip;] Where would you draw the line? Your answer cannot be right or wrong. [&hellip;]
>Of course, the leak represents an inefficiency. The inefficiencies of real-world redistribution include the adverse effects on the economic incentives of the rich and the poor, and the administrative costs of tax-collection and transfer programs.

### Second Best

<!-- multicolumn setup .................................................... -->
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

* lump-sum implies no behavioral substitution response 
* in reality, howver, all taxes and transfers are distortionary

* illustration: redistribution implies efficiency losses that shift UPF inwards
* *Second Best*, $S$: maximize social welfare subject to the constraint that efficiency losses are unavoidable

* trade-off: equity $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ redistribution $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$  taxes $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$  welfare costs $\uparrow$

### Summary

* [Pareto]{.smallcaps} efficiency is a key concept for societal welfare
     + it embodies the exhaustion of gains from trade through voluntary action
     + to achieve it, one can rely on competitive markets (1st Theorem)

<br>

* [Pareto]{.smallcaps} efficiency does not account for inequality concerns
* The social welfare function does allow to reflect inequality aversion
* The first-best social choice combines the quest for efficiency with views on equity
* To achieve the first best, lump-sum taxes and transfers may be needed (2nd Theorem)

<br>

* distortionary taxation allows at most second best social choice (efficiency-equity tradeoff)
