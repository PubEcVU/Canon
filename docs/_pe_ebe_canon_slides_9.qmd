### Income & Substitution Effects of Wage Change

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Wage Change

* What happens to your labor supply when you get a pay rise (wage rate $w\uparrow$)?
* note: you **own** your time that you can allocate to leisure or to work, so $w\uparrow$ makes value of time endowment more valuable 
* $w\uparrow$: budget constraint rotates outward        
* could do: work more because leisure got more expensive (substitution effect), or less because time got worth more (income effect)
* Depends on which effect dominates empirically.

*click on walkthrough for the following:*

1. starting from an optimal choice \textcolor{red}{$\star$}, 
2. an increase in the wage rate, $w\uparrow$ leads to a rightward rotation of the budget constraint around the time endowment point $H$ (max hours worked)
3. a negative compensation payment shifts the budget constraint back to the original (red) indifference curve, point \textcolor{red}{$\circ$}

The substitution effect on leisure \textcolor{red}{$\star$}$\to$\textcolor{red}{$\circ$}, due to opportunity cost of leisure rising, is always $\le 0$

4. if income effect \textcolor{red}{$\circ$}$\to$\textcolor{blue}{$\bullet$} on leisure $>0$, indivdual may work less (total effect on leisure possibly positive)
5. if it is negative, more (total effect on leisure negative)

### Nonlinear Budget Constraints

* taxes on earnings can be studied in a simple labor supply model
* \textcolor{lightgray}{compare: welfare benefits}
* disincentive effects on labor supply, depending on (compensated) elasticities
* due to progressive taxes and tax credits/allowances, real-world budget restrictions are typically nonlinear
* nondifferentiability and nonconvexities:<br> corners, kinks, holes, jumps and bunching
* choices may not be unique
* small tax changes changes can lead to large responses


<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Nonlinear Budget Constraint and Labor Supply

* consider standard model of labor supply (with time endowment $H$)
    + lump sum tax (amount $T_L$)
    + proportional (flat) income tax at rate $t$
    + progressive income tax with 2 brackets at rates $t_1=0$, $t_2>t$
        - leads to nonlinear (kinked) budget constraint at earnings level $w\cdot h_1$
* holding after-tax welfare levels constant<br>  denote:    
* after-tax wage earnings
    + $w \cdot h - T_L$
    + $(1-t) \cdot w \cdot h$
    + $w \cdot h_1 + (1-t_2) \cdot w [h-h_1]$

*click on walkthrough for the following:*

1. starting from an optimal choice \textcolor{blue}{$\star$}, 
2. progressive tax leads to a downward rotation of the budget constraint around the lower limit of the second tax bracket (earnings $w \cdot h_1$), and choice \textcolor{red}{$\bullet$}
3. green line indicates tax revenue (equals \textcolor{red}{$\bullet$}--\textcolor{blue}{$\bullet$})
4. non-distortionary tax (blue dashed line) would have led to choice \textcolor{red}{$\circ$}
5. and to higher tax revenue (orange line; equals \textcolor{red}{$\circ$}--\textcolor{blue}{$\circ$})

* excess burden (related to the substitution effect) equal to the difference between orange and green tax revenues

6. flat tax at constant rate $t$ (pink line) leads to choice \textcolor{pink}{$\star$}
7. with intermediate level of tax revenue (vertical pink line; equals \textcolor{pink}{$\star$}--\textcolor{blue}{$\star$}) and excess burden

### Flat Tax and Redistribution

* progressive systems are a good redistributional tool
* but also have large welfare losses (excess burdens)
* flat tax may seem to redistribute less
* however, overall progressivity of the tax-and-benefit system matters
* i.e., with a flat tax and benefits targeted at the poor, redistributional goals can be achieved
* also likely to limit welfare losses
* administrative simplicity and transparency

### Incentive Compatible Income Tax Design

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Idea

* suppose differences in labor incomes are due to differences in productivity, which ultimately are due to differences in talents
* first best: (lump-sum) tax based on talents or skills / endowment of innate abilities
* [Mirrlees]{.smallcaps}: assume talents are unobservable to the gov't
* incentive for the smart guys to pretend they're not (and thus pay lower taxes)  
* second best solution: max social welfare subject to balanced budget, and taking into account incentives to reveal one's talent

#### Setup I

* consider 2 types of agents (\textcolor{red}{$h$},\textcolor{blue}{$\ell$}): high and low ability
* asymmetric info: gov't cannot tell whether an individual is \textcolor{red}{$h$} or \textcolor{blue}{$\ell$}
* main issue: \textcolor{red}{$h$} worker may pretend to be \textcolor{blue}{$\ell$} to pay lower taxes (but \textcolor{blue}{$\ell$} will not pretend to be \textcolor{red}{$h$} because lower skills make earning higher income very costly)

#### Setup II

picture:

* 2 dimensions: before-tax income and after-tax consumption on axes
    + note: horizontal axes (gross earnings: $w\cdot h$) differs from consumption-labor supply diagram (leisure: $H-h$)
* **agent monotonicity**: for a given combination of before-tax income and consumption, \textcolor{red}{$h$} have flatter indifference curves because it takes them lower effort cost to generate a given level of income than \textcolor{blue}{$\ell$}
* tax function: vertical distance from 45$^\circ$-line reflects tax payment; slope = marginal tax rate
    + note: both agents must face the same tax function

#### Setup III

* design problem: how to optimally set marginal tax rates so that social welfare is maximized, and incomes can be redistributed, without giving \textcolor{red}{$h$} incentive to masquerade as \textcolor{blue}{$\ell$}?
* marginal tax rate cannot exceed 100%, because with convex indifference curves noone would choose to be on a downward sloping segment of a tax function
* marginal tax rate cannot be $<0$ as SWF-improvement possible
* marginal tax rate cannot be $\neq 0$ for \textcolor{red}{$h$}

#### Video

![](images/optinctax.mp4){width="80%"}


#### Findings

* if talents determine wages, then highest parts of wage income should optimally be taxed at marginal rate zero
* this maximizes social welfare with a balanced budget

\bigskip

* result: self-selection
    + it incentivizes highest skill level workers to display maximal effort
    + low skill workers would find this level of effort provision too costly

\bigskip

* note: this does not mean 
    + the marginal tax rate should be zero everywhere
    + the average tax rate should be zero
* yet, counterintuitive and not observed in practice

<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Additional Remarks

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Design Literature

* [Mirrlees]{.smallcaps} (1971) result helped establish new literature on asymmetric information, incentives, and mechanism design
* important example of ''no-distortion-at-the-top'' principle
* designing correct incentive structure has many other applications in economics
* for actual tax design of limited practical importance, however

#### Median Voter Results

* in political process, tax rates are endogenous (chosen)
* with a simple flat tax system with lump-sum transfers, the poorer stand to gain and the richer stand to lose  from redistribution
* if median voter is relatively poor, redistribution will result through choosing high tax rates
* in real-world income distributions median$<$mean
* [Piketty]{.smallcaps}: 'utimately, the poor always win'

## Savings and Taxes {background-color="#acfaf7"}

### Savings and Capital Income

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Capital income

* under personal income tax laws, consumers pay tax on capital income received
* this may come in various forms, e.g.:
* dividends (firm's profits received by shareholders)
* rent (lease) received
* capital gains (change of wealth due to asset price changes)
    + realized capital gains: difference between price when actually sold and price when actually bought [US]
    + unrealized capital gains: difference between valuation at time $t$ and at time $t-1$ (sold or not)
* interest receipts on savings
    + possibly minus interest payments on debt

#### NL

+ tax on savings and investment ('box 3'): 
+ until 2016: 30% on fictitious return of 4% (=1.2% on wealth)
+ after 2016: progressive (still fictitious)
+ 2021: Supreme Court ruling demands taxation of actual returns (to be implemented by 2027+)

*click on walkthrough for the following:*

1. starting from intertemporal distribution of income endowment $Y$, intertemporal budget contraint of slope $-(1+r)$
2. consumption smoothing leads to choice $C$ and implies saving or borrowing, depending on relative position between $Y$ and $C$
2. symmetric taxation of interest income at rate $t$ leads to net-of-tax returns $(1+r(1-t))$ (orange line)
3. and a new consumption choice
4. asymmetric taxation of interest income: most common case: no interest payment deductibility from income tax, while interest income is taxed (differential treatment saving/borrowing)
5. result of asymmetry depends on whether taxpayer is saver or borrower

## Conclusions and Summary {.unnumbered background-color="#acfaf7"}

### Summary

* earnings taxes have both substitution and income effects, but smaller DWL under flat tax
* progressive income tax often used for stronger redistributional aims
* but even under flat tax, redistribution is possible
* optimal income tax: no-distortion-at-the-top suggests zero top marginal rate
* capital taxation on savings/interest for consumers may have both substitution and income effects, and can affect consumer wealth accumulation dynamically
