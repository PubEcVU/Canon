### Second Best 

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Lump Sum

* 2nd theorem: 'more equity' (equality) involves lump-sum redistribution
* lump sum: form of taxation that is not tied to individual's choices (e.g.: income,  consumption, wealth), but only to the identity of the tax payer
    + tax payer cannot influence his tax bill
    + unrealistic; closest example: [UK Poll Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_tax_(Great_Britain)){target="_blank"} found [little political support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_tax_riots){target="_blank"} 
    + needs to be heterogeneous since goal is redistribution  (some lose, some gain)
    + needs to be based on private preference information
* reason: do not want substitution effects, as they lead to welfare losses

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="'First Theorem of Public Finance': There is no such thing as a lump-sum tax."}
::: 

* i.o.w.: all taxation is distortionary

#### [Okun]{.smallcaps}'s Leaky Bucket

Consider a redistribution program that takes from the rich and gives to the poor.

> <q> [&hellip;] the money must be carried from the rich to the poor in a leaky bucket.  Some of it will simply disappear in transit, so the poor will not receive 
all the money that is taken from the rich. [&hellip;]
> I want you to decide how much leakage you would accept and still support [this plan]. Suppose 10 percent leaks out [&hellip;] Should society still make the switch? If 50 percent leaks out? 75 percent? [&hellip;] Where would you draw the line? Your answer cannot be right or wrong. [&hellip;]
>Of course, the leak represents an inefficiency. The inefficiencies of real-world redistribution include the adverse effects on the economic incentives of the rich and the poor, and the administrative costs of tax-collection and transfer programs.<br>

#### Implications

Implications for the Cost of Public Activity

* if all taxation is distortionary, then public finance-relevant activities will be associated with the (social) welfare cost of raising taxes

* these [social cost of public funds]{.alert} should be held as small as possible, but are unavoidable

* denote the marginal social cost of public funds by $\lambda$, then we say that tax-financing a public project of \$1 costs \$1+$\lambda$ in terms of real economic resources
    + $\lambda=0$ first-best
    + $\lambda>0$ second-best

### Inverse Elasticity Rule

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Idea 

* many markets & economic activities $\to$ many possibilities to tax
* each tax leads to revenue and excess burdens
* if we add it all up, we get total tax revenue, and a total welfare loss of taxation
* the total revenue could be a *target value* of fiscal policy, a **revenue requirement** to finance public tasks
* but: we can choose each time how to tax, how much to tax and whom to tax 
* all of this may have an impact on revenue and excess burdens in individual markets
* so: what's the 'optimal' **tax mix** that
    + minimizes the total welfare loss
    + while meeting the revenue requirement?

#### Solution

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="Inverse Elasticity Rule."}

The total welfare loss of taxation is being minimized when<br>
tax rates are inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand<br>
(holding constant the price elasticity of supply).

::: 

* a given tax revenue should be achieved using a tax-mix where commodities/activities with the lowest price elasticities are being taxed most 
* smallest total *allocative* distortion

#### Example 1

* 2 commodity markets, 2 tax rates: $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$
* deadweight losses: $DWL_1(\tau_1)$ and $DWL_2(\tau_2)$; and tax revenues: $T_1(\tau_1)$, $T_2(\tau_2)$ 
* goal: minimize total deadweight loss $DWL_1+DWL_2$<br> subject to total tax revenue $T_1+T_2$ being a constant $R$ (revenue constraint)
* tax rates are choice variables (policy parameters)
* technique: Lagrange (with multiplier $\lambda$)

$$\min_{\tau_1,\tau_2,\lambda}  {\cal L} = DWL_1(\tau_1)+DWL_2(\tau_2) + \lambda (R - T_1(\tau_1)-T_2(\tau_2))$$

* interpretation $\lambda$: shadow price of tax revenue in terms of efficiency losses

#### (cont'd.)

$$\min_{\tau_1,\tau_2,\lambda}  {\cal L} = \overbrace{10\tau_1^2}^{DWL_1(\tau_1)}+\overbrace{15\tau_2^2}^{DWL_2(\tau_2)} + \lambda (\overbrace{4.9}^{R} - \overbrace{[8\tau_1-5\tau_1^2]}^{T_1(\tau_1)}-\overbrace{[10\tau_2-7.5\tau_2^2]}^{T_2(\tau_2)})$$

FOCs<br>
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial {\cal L} }{\partial \tau_1}  &=&20\tau_1-\lambda (8-10\tau_1)=0\\
\frac{\partial {\cal L} }{\partial \tau_2}  &=&30\tau_2-\lambda (10-15\tau_2)=0\\
\frac{\partial {\cal L} }{\partial \lambda} &=& 4.9-[8\tau_1-5\tau_1^2]-[10\tau_2-7.5\tau_2^2]=0
\end{eqnarray*}

solution: $\tau^\star_2=0.333$ and $\tau^\star_1=0.4$

#### Example 2

* for *ad valorem* tax (`$1+t_j$'), DWL can be written 
$$DWL_j = \frac{1}{2} t_j^2 \cdot Q_{tj} p_{j}\cdot \eta_j^D,\quad j=1,2$$ 

* together with $T_j = t_j \cdot Q_{tj} p_{j}$, get
$$\min_{t_1,t_2,\lambda}  {\cal L} = \frac{1}{2} t_1^2 \cdot Q_{t1} p_{1}\cdot \eta_1^D+\frac{1}{2} t_2^2 \cdot Q_{t2} p_{2}\cdot \eta_2^D + \lambda (R-t_1 \cdot Q_{t1} p_{1}-t_2 \cdot Q_{t2} p_{2})$$

* then the FOCs lead to $t_1\eta^D_1=\lambda$ and $t_2\eta^D_2=\lambda$        

* from which follows
        $$\frac{t_1}{t_2}=\frac{\eta^D_2}{\eta^D_1}.$$

### Further Aspects

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Critique

+ inverse elasticity rule suggests market-specific tax rates
    + heterogeneous taxation is second-best efficient
    + based on [Paretian]{.smallcaps} Welfare concept
+ involves complicated, intransparent tax rate system when there are many goods
+ high information and compliance cost for taxpayers
+ simplifies: no direct link between markets, e.g. $DWL_1(\tau_1)\neq DWL_1(\tau_1,\tau_2)$
+ [Paretian]{.smallcaps} Welfare does not take into account equity considerations
    + e.g., tax immobile tax payers, shift burden to those who will not substitute away

#### Equity

* maximize SWF, e.g., in  two-consumer ($A$, $B$) economy
        $$W(u^A(q^A_1,q^A_2),u^B(q^B_1,q^B_2))$$
        subject to the constraint that tax revenue must be collected from both consumers' demand for all goods
* commodity demands are $q^i_j, i=A,B; j=1,2$
* explicit use of SWF allows trading off interest between consumers (equity)

#### Social Welfare Weights

* maximization of SWF,
        $$\max_{\tau_1,\tau_2} W(u^A(q^A_1(\tau_1),q^A_2(\tau_2)),u^B(q^B_1(\tau_1),q^B_2(\tau_2)))$$
        will require assessing social welfare weights per individual; e.g. FOC for $\tau_1$ involve
        $$\frac{\text{d} W}{\text{d}\tau_1} = \underbrace{\frac{\partial W}{\partial u^A} \cdot \frac{\partial u^A}{\partial q_1^A}}_{\equiv \omega^A_1} 
        \cdot \frac{\partial q_1^A}{\partial \tau_1}
        + \frac{\partial W}{\partial u^B} \cdot \frac{\partial u^B}{\partial q_1^B}
        \cdot \frac{\partial q_1^B}{\partial \tau_1}
        $$
* $\omega^A_1$ (and similarly, $\omega^B_1$) is a social marginal welfare weight for $A$;
        i.e., the value that society puts on providing an additional $ of consumption of good 1 to individual $A$
* note: it is customary to use marg.\ utility of income for ${\partial u^A}/{\partial q_j^A}$


#### [Ramsey]{.smallcaps} Rule

* in more general setting, demand for all goods could depend on prices of all other goods
* hence, dependence on all tax rates in the system
* changing a single tax rate has implications through the change of relative prices for all markets
* without proof (see H&M book for derivation:)

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="[Ramsey]{.smallcaps} Rule."}

Set optimal commodity tax rates such that *compensated demand* for each good is reduced in the same proportion relative to the before-tax position.

:::

* recall: compensated demand nets out income effects (substitution effects matter for efficiency!)
* observe: simplest setting abstracts from equity considerations (demand system of a single consumer)

### Behavioral Aspects

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Internalities

* internalities are 'within-person externalities' -- effects of one's own current behavior on one's own future welfare, or welfare in a different state of nature
* mostly relevant in intertemporal contexts that view an individual at different points in time has having 'different selves'
    + example: the present self may choose to smoke today, even though the future self may want the present self to quit today; this way, the present self causes a spillover effect on the future self (who is less likely to quit tomorrow)
* policy response can make current measures salient and refer to future consequences
    + example: very high cigarette taxes combined with shock-images

#### Psychology

* economic psychologists emphasize a distinction of utilities
    + decision utility
        - utility on which an individual takes actions, resulting in observed choices
    + experienced utility
        - utility the individual uses to assess actual welfare of a choice made
* when decision and experience are separated in time, and when individual display behavioral biases, the difference can lead to
    + making a choice now
    + regretting it later (welfare loss)

* note: neoclassical approach does not distinguish different selves (time consistency)
* corollary: revealed preference paradigm -- what you want shows in what you do

<!-- END multicolumn setup ................................................ -->

#### Policy

* behavioral tendencies change the translation of externalities into welfare losses
    + they can mitigate or exarcerbate the problem by over-/understating relevant (marginal) costs and benefits
    + depends on context
* behavioral tendencies can also generate externalities directly        
* internalities may compound the analytical complexity
* consumer heterogeneity big issue: problem of aggregation
* difficult to make clear-cut policy prescriptions

### Health & Taxes

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Health

* sugar intake associated with severe health consequences
* type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, are leading causes of disability and death
* significant increase in health care costs, lost wages due to illnesses and disability, reduced work productivity, earlier retirement, etc.\
* increasing obesity prevalence is now a bigger problem in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries
* 2015, 1/3 of global population overweight or obese, rapidly increasing prevalence
* prevalence of overweight or obesity:
    + global rise by 60\% since 1990 for preschool-aged children
    + example Mexico: above 40\% in older children

#### Taxes

* taxes change behavior
* specific commodity taxes: target specific commodities (e.g., diesel, gasoline), and constant per unit of the consumed good or substance (e.g., 80c/$\ell$)
* also associated with goods of which gov't wants to discourage consumption, hence the name 'sin' tax (e.g., alcohol, nicotine -- aka demerit goods)
* recently: sugar tax, in response to secular rise in sugar consumption and causal links to adverse health behaviors and outcomes 
* if those outcomes affect others (directly or indirectly, e.g., via inflated health insurance premiums), sin taxes are meant to correct externalities
* if those outcomes affect only the consumer (or a 'future self' of that person), sin taxes are meant to correct internalities

#### Equity

* strong negative association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and income
* tax incidence of SSB will fall predominantly on the poor
* however: some evidence that sin taxes work and reduce consumption
* policy issue: how to trade off the welfare gains from SSB taxation and the distributional consequences?
* aspect: both gains and burdens concentrated in similar demographics

### Sin Tax with Full Pass-Through
#### Individual Consumer

![](images/intern.mp4)

<!-- ** NEW SLIDE ********************************************************* -->
### Further Considerations

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Aggregation

* need to aggregate from individual consumer to market level
* aggregation of externalities across consumers: weigh with difference between marginal welfare weight $\omega$ and value of public funds $\lambda$ (since sin tax reduces public revenue distortion: e.g., less sugar consumption -- better health -- lower public health cost)
* aggregation of internalities across consumers: weigh with marginal welfare weight $\omega$ (disregard public funds, as no effect on, e.g., public health cost)

#### Welfare Weights

social marginal welfare weights $\omega$

* inequality concern: the poor may have higher weights in a social welfare function        
* incidence: if the poor also consume more sugar, the sin tax falls disproportionately on them        
* if internalities are important, they may at the same time benefit disproportionately

#### Correlations

* externalities:  correlation between individual demand elasticity and individual's contribution to externality
    + possibly positive: consumers <br> generating the largest externalities are most responsive to the tax
        - then, externality benefits of sugar tax are larger
* internalities: negative correlation sugar consumption and income: 
    + tax burden regressive
        - but: internality benefits of sugar tax likely progressive

### Aspects for Optimal Tax Policy In Practice

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Welfare

welfare assessment and optimal taxation depend on 

* whether externalities are present
* whether internalities are present
* who pays the taxes and who benefits or is harmed by ex/internalities
* demand (and supply) elasticities / pass-through
* preference heterogeneity across the income distribution
* complementarity/substitutability with untaxed, sugar-based consumption goods
* leakage effects (e.g., cross-border shopping)

#### Policy

* optimality suggests: highly complex tax system

* issue: conflicts with principles of good taxation
    + transparency
    + simplicity
    + universality
    + neutrality

* to keep it simple (manageable):
    + tax (physical) sugar content
    + apply to broad tax base (not just drinks, not just locally)

#### Empirics

* determining the size of demand elasticities, as well as the extent of internalities, externalities and regressivity is
    + very complicated        
    + requires very detailed microeconomic data
    + suitable empirical approaches
* authors of the study come up with a rough advice of 1.5 cents per ounce (5.4 c/100 g)

## Conclusions and Summary {.unnumbered background-color="#acfaf7"}

### Summary

* Lump-sum taxes and transfers, as required by the Second Theorem do not exist, hence distortionary taxation allows at most second best social choice (efficiency-equity tradeoff)
* good tax policy-making is in general complex, but also needs transparency
* elasticities can be used to guide the choice which activities to tax most
* yet, equity considerations may suggest that the income position of households should be taken into account
* taxes can be used in addition to protect consumers from themselves, but normative judgment involved (do policy makers think that consumers are not acting in their own best interest)?
